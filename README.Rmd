# SETr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of SETr is to simplify calculations and make graphs for QA/QC and communication of Surface Elevation Table (SET) data.  

This package is under development, based on functions created as part of a larger workflow. All code for that project is also on [GitHub, here](https://github.com/swmpkim/SETr_Reserve_Template); and at the top of the README for that repo are links to publicly available project outputs. Most of the functions here were used in the [Reserve-level technical reports](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ExY94WWOoS3iY3iJpKdteI96_iFnDdMM?usp=sharing). At first, certain column names will have to exist in the data frames that these functions are used on. As time permits, I hope to add some flexibility.  

This README still needs a lot of attention too; the example below is very minimal. 

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("swmpkim/SETr")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to make a simple graph of change since the first reading at each SET:

```{r example, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(SETr)

# first, perform cumulative change calculations
cumu_set <- calc_change_cumu(example_sets)

# now plot cumulative change by SET
plot_cumu_set(cumu_set$set)

# or by arm, at a single SET
plot_cumu_arm(cumu_set$arm)
```
